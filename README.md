# HDR UK Schemata - Dataset V2.0.0

### 1. [HDR UK Dataset Schema](https://github.com/HDRUK/schemata/blob/develop/docs/dataset/latest/dataset.md)

 - Latest json schema and yml can be found here:  https://github.com/HDRUK/schemata/blob/develop/schema/dataset/latest
 - Example json files can be found here including a current mapped dataset, a minimium json example and a ful example: https://github.com/HDRUK/schemata/blob/develop/examples 
 - Latest word documentation, change log and mapping file can be found here: https://github.com/HDRUK/schemata/tree/develop/docs/dataset/2.0.0/distribution
 - Impact assessment and indicative mapping files can be found here: https://github.com/HDRUK/schemata/tree/develop/docs/dataset/2.0.0/impact-assessment
      - aggregated_errors.xlsx: aggregated validation errors with an overview on the most common errors per attribute that will need to be resolved during migration
      - generated_mapping.py: the mapping algorithm that generates v2 data-models, (basically a mapping function for all fields in the new v2 specs).
      - v1_to_v2.json: for each data-model (key is the UUID) v1: old schema, v2: new schema, which is the mapping result (generated_mapping.py) of all data-models in the gateway.
      - dm_validation.json: for each data-model (key again is UUID) the data-set in form of the v2 attributes and the JSON schema validation.
      - aggregated_errors.json: an aggregation of the validation of all data-models by attribute with a list of unique error messages, a count of unique error messages, and a total count of the errors across all data-models; note that JSON schema validator generates an entry for all hierarchy levels, which means some error messages are repeated along the hierarchy.

### 2. Dataset Properties Breakdown

Below is the breakdown of the HDR UK V2 Dataset Schema by its properties and sub properties as defined in the [JSON Schema](https://github.com/HDRUK/schemata/blob/develop/schema/dataset/latest/dataset.schema.json). Each property from 1-7 has its own Schema with a description of its corresponding sub properties, including their data type and whether it is a required field.

### 3. [Metadata Quality Scoring](https://github.com/JakeBGitHub/datasets/tree/dataset-v2-scores/reports#hdr-uk-data-documentation-scores)

Once a dataset is onboarded onto the Gateway, a quality check is run on its corresponding json schema to produce a weighted quality score based on weighted field completeness and weighted field error percentage. Weights of each field can be found here (https://github.com/HDRUK/datasets/tree/dataset-v2-scores/config/weights) and details of the quality score calculation can be found here (https://github.com/HDRUK/datasets/tree/dataset-v2-scores/reports).
