# Dataset Abstract Schema

```txt
#/summary/abstract#/definitions/summary/properties/abstract
```

Provide a clear and brief descriptive signpost for researchers who are searching for data that may be relevant to their research. The abstract should allow the reader to determine the scope of the data collection and accurately summarise its content. The optimal length is one paragraph (limited to 255 characters) and effective abstracts should avoid long sentences and abbreviations where possible
