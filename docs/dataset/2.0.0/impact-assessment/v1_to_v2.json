HES DID includes information on imaging tests carried out from 1 April 2012 on NHS patients in England. It does not include the images that are produced as a result of these tests. HES DID captures information about referral source and patient type, details of the test (type of test and body site), plus items about waiting times for each diagnostic imaging event, from time of test request through to time of reporting. The DID enables analysis of demographic and geographic variation in access to different test types and different providers, enabling users to analyse patient care pathways.",

This is further detailed in the technical specification (see \u2018return submission details\u2019). \n\nWhere the initial assessment and birth events take place in different Health Boards, data will be linked nationally by the NHS Wales Informatics Service.\n\nVelindre NHS Trust are excluded from this requirement, as they do not provide any maternity services.\n\nMonthly activity data must include only initial assessment and birth activity that took place in the previous month.",

      "description": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201905-1017OC \n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs\u2019 flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility. \nMeta-analysis of GWAS of IPF susceptibility. Building up on published GWAS results (PMID: 24429156, 23583980, 29066090) and novel study samples, we have performed the largest GWAS of IPF susceptibility to date to identify novel genes and further advance in the understanding of IPF pathogenesis and risk (bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/636761 and PMID:31710517). The discovery stage of the study comprised up to 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls from 3 studies (Chicago study: 541 IPF cases and 542 controls, Colorado study: 1515 fibrotic Idiopathic Interstitial pneumonia cases and 4683 controls, UK Study: 612 IPF cases and 3366 controls)  and replication was pursued in an additional 1,456 IPF cases and 11,874 controls. The genome-wide association study summary statistics from the meta-analysis of three studies totalling  2,668 cases and 8,591 controls are available here.",

        "description": "https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201905-1017OC \n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. It is believed that the damage to the alveolar epithelium is followed by an aberrant wound healing response leading to the deposition of dense fibrotic tissue, reducing the lungs\u2019 flexibility and inhibiting gas transfer. IPF still has limited therapeutic interventions and a high mortality rate within 3-5 years from diagnosis. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF susceptibility have associated common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]>5%) near genes involved in host defence, telomere maintenance, cell-cell adhesion and signalling in disease susceptibility. \nMeta-analysis of GWAS of IPF susceptibility. Building up on published GWAS results (PMID: 24429156, 23583980, 29066090) and novel study samples, we have performed the largest GWAS of IPF susceptibility to date to identify novel genes and further advance in the understanding of IPF pathogenesis and risk (bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/636761 and PMID:31710517). The discovery stage of the study comprised up to 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls from 3 studies (Chicago study: 541 IPF cases and 542 controls, Colorado study: 1515 fibrotic Idiopathic Interstitial pneumonia cases and 4683 controls, UK Study: 612 IPF cases and 3366 controls)  and replication was pursued in an additional 1,456 IPF cases and 11,874 controls. The genome-wide association study summary statistics from the meta-analysis of three studies totalling  2,668 cases and 8,591 controls are available here.",

      "description": "Bariatric surgery produces substantial, long-term weight loss with reduced morbidity and mortality. Genetics can strongly influence this response, as well as the initial propensity to obesity. Several genes have been implicated but more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to understand how genes affect energy regulation and mediate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.\nThe Obesity Research Biobank Syndicate (ORBiS) aims to fulfil this need. It provides a comprehensive collection of high-quality biological samples and patient data to facilitate mechanistic research and help translate it to improved treatments for patients. \nPatients undergoing bariatric surgery are recruited from multiple centres in the UK. With informed consent, blood or saliva samples are collected pre-operatively and tissue collected during surgery. Samples include: adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), muscle, liver, stomach and small intestine. Relevant clinical and demographic data are linked and stored pseudo anonymised in a secure database. Tissue collections are transported to and processed in the ORBiS laboratory at University College London, and stored at UCL-Royal Free Hospital Biobank for future use.\nResearch programmes will be supported within and beyond the contributing sites. External researchers will be required to obtain individual REC approval prior to submitting an application.",

        "description": "Bariatric surgery produces substantial, long-term weight loss with reduced morbidity and mortality. Genetics can strongly influence this response, as well as the initial propensity to obesity. Several genes have been implicated but more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed to understand how genes affect energy regulation and mediate the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.\nThe Obesity Research Biobank Syndicate (ORBiS) aims to fulfil this need. It provides a comprehensive collection of high-quality biological samples and patient data to facilitate mechanistic research and help translate it to improved treatments for patients. \nPatients undergoing bariatric surgery are recruited from multiple centres in the UK. With informed consent, blood or saliva samples are collected pre-operatively and tissue collected during surgery. Samples include: adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), muscle, liver, stomach and small intestine. Relevant clinical and demographic data are linked and stored pseudo anonymised in a secure database. Tissue collections are transported to and processed in the ORBiS laboratory at University College London, and stored at UCL-Royal Free Hospital Biobank for future use.\nResearch programmes will be supported within and beyond the contributing sites. External researchers will be required to obtain individual REC approval prior to submitting an application.",

Includes spell and episode level data.\n\nThe data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).\n\nThe data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:\n\nCounts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;\nThere are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.\nWhen looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.\nCoding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.\n\nDue to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team. In turn the SAIL will seek advice from NWIS if required.",

        "description": "NHS Wales hospital admissions (Inpatients and daycases) dataset comprising of attendance and clinical information for all hospital admissions: includes diagnoses and operations performed. Includes spell and episode level data.\n\nThe data are collected and coded at each hospital. Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS).\n\nThe data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example:\n\nCounts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields;\nThere are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures.\nWhen looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included.\nCoding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies.\n\nDue to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team. In turn the SAIL will seek advice from NWIS if required.",

      "description": "The HBRC is an HTA-licensed biorepository dedicated to the collection of appropriately consented high quality human biomaterials, their processing, storage and distribution to biomedical researchers. The HBRC resides within the purpose-built Advanced Therapies Facility (ATF) within the College of Medical and Dental Sciences (CMDS) at the University of Birmingham (UoB). The ATF also houses both cell and gene therapy manufacturing units.\nSamples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful. \nAlthough the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered. The policy and procedures associated with the review of these applications, and the subsequent release of samples and associated data, are the same for both internal and external applicants. All samples and associated data are released for research in a fully anonymised form, and a Tissue Transfer Agreement ensures that they will only be used for the purposes approved at release and will not be transferred without written permission. In order to enhance the value of the HBRC collection, every attempt is made to secure the return of useful research data following the completion of research studies.",

        "description": "The HBRC is an HTA-licensed biorepository dedicated to the collection of appropriately consented high quality human biomaterials, their processing, storage and distribution to biomedical researchers. The HBRC resides within the purpose-built Advanced Therapies Facility (ATF) within the College of Medical and Dental Sciences (CMDS) at the University of Birmingham (UoB). The ATF also houses both cell and gene therapy manufacturing units.\nSamples are collected, processed and stored (or released) from patients in a variety of disease settings in response to local demand and research strategies in order to facilitate existing research and enable future research areas to be developed. Samples may comprise adult or paediatric tissue which is waste, or surplus to diagnosis taken at the time of surgery or treatment, additional samples taken specifically for research purposes, material taken from patients enrolled in clinical trials, and control material. The HBRC works with local researchers and carries out bespoke tissue collections. All samples can be annotated with the appropriate clinical data which makes them scientifically useful. \nAlthough the HBRC is primarily a resource for local researchers within CMDS and local NHS Trusts, applications from other UK research groups and the commercial sector are also considered. The policy and procedures associated with the review of these applications, and the subsequent release of samples and associated data, are the same for both internal and external applicants. All samples and associated data are released for research in a fully anonymised form, and a Tissue Transfer Agreement ensures that they will only be used for the purposes approved at release and will not be transferred without written permission. In order to enhance the value of the HBRC collection, every attempt is made to secure the return of useful research data following the completion of research studies.",

The survey was conducted by Quality Health in conjunction with three cancer registries in England. The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis. Outcome items in the survey are made up of Euroqol 5-level (EQ-5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), and Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI) items.",

        "description": "CPRD Aurum linked Quality of Life of Cancer Survivors in England: Pilot Survey (2011) was commissioned by the Department of Health as part of the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative (NCSI). The survey was conducted by Quality Health in conjunction with three cancer registries in England. The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis. Outcome items in the survey are made up of Euroqol 5-level (EQ-5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), and Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI) items.",

Material is available to researchers internationally following registration with the tissue bank.  Jointly funded by the MRC and Wellcome Trust, the biobank has been operating since 1999 and is based at two centres: Institute of Genetic Medicine '\u201c Newcastle University and the Institute of Child Health '\u201c University College London.\nTissues can be dissected to meet specific research needs and samples supplied fixed or frozen for histology or nucleic acid extraction, or the tissue can be collected into culture media to be used to establish cell lines. Material pre-sectioned to microscope slides is available for immunohistochemistry (IHC) or tissue in situ hybridisation studies (TISH) and stage, tissue specific RNA/DNA/cDNA can be requested.\nOur In House Gene Expression Service will perform IHC or TISH experiments on behalf of registered users and provide them with high quality annotated images of results ready for publication.",

      "description": "GOSH is the custodian of the most recent study dataset (\u201cIMPORT\u201d - 650 patients, 2012-2019). All of the trial/study datasets include: Full patient and tumour\ndemographics, including associated congenital abnormalities, tumour stage, treatment received (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) with individual drug names and doses and additional pathological details on histological subtype (risk group), follow up for relapse and death. In addition, the most recent study \u2013 \u201cIMPORT\u201d (Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood) contains data on the presenting symptoms that led to diagnosis of kidney cancer,\nan imaging archive of CT and MRI scans sent for central radiology review and biological samples (frozen tumour, blood, normal kidney) stored centrally on ~two\nthirds of cases. There is also tumour genomic copy number data available on about one third of the prior trial \u2013 SIOP WT 2001 (that ran in the UK, 2002-2011).\n\nChildhood renal tumour dataset\n\nThis document describes the research dataset constructed through the Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study from 2012 \u2013 2019 (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/study-improving-treatment-children-kidney-cancer. The aim of this prospective clinical observational study is to achieve continuous improvement in short and long term outcomes for children with Wilms tumour and other rarer types of childhood renal tumours. The study collects clinical, molecular and imaging data to underpin the introduction of a more personalised approach to risk stratification \u2013 the process by which each child is assigned to one of several \u2018standard of care\u2019 treatment arms according to the predicted risk of their tumour recurring. \n\nIt is a live database, currently comprising data on 670 children with kidney tumours who are resident across the UK and Republic of Ireland. This represents >90% of all incident cases diagnosed in the population. Clinical data and patient samples are collected with explicit consent of their parent/guardian for use in research and for sharing with the relevant national cancer registration service according to where the child is resident at diagnosis.\n\nData are collected throughout the patient journey and are presented in tables with each data item as a comma separated value (CSV) corresponding to a data field captured through a case report form (CRF). These span the following timepoints from presentation to completion of treatment and then annual follow up or reporting of any events (relapse/death/second tumour). \n\nF1 Registration information\nF2 Pre-operative chemotherapy (Unilateral tumours only)\nF3 Surgical form \u2013 operative findings\nF4 Pathology form \u2013 institutional pathologist\nF6 Post-operative chemotherapy\nF11 Cardiotoxicity reporting form\nF12 Bilateral Wilms tumour form \u2013 additional registration information (12a) and response assessment (12b)\nF15 Reference Pathology \u2013 \u201cCentral review\u201d\nF17 Treatment of relapse or progression\nF18 Follow up form \u2013 for annual follow up reporting and to report any relapse or death.\nF20A End of treatment summary (Unilateral tumours)\nF20B End of treatment summary (Bilateral tumours)\n\nDetails of the content of each CRF are in the table below.\n\nMost children (~90%) with Wilms tumour survive their cancer. Hence, an important aspect of the dataset is the planned linkage of each child\u2019s data to their national cancer registration record. This will permit measurement of very long term health outcomes in adulthood by linkage to routine health care data utilising the approved information governance systems through which the UK\u2019s national cancer registration services work with the NHS to ensure patient confidentiality. \n\nThe IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020.\n\nThese trials\u2019 primary endpoints, of relapse-free and overall survival according to clinically defined risk groups, have been published, with full clinical quality assurance completed. Over that 39 year period, risk stratification and treatment schedules have been refined many times, to reduce exposure to therapies that may cause long term side effects such as heart damage or second tumours. These adverse \u2018late effects\u2019 may take decades before they are first seen. Hence, these linked datasets are an important proof of principle about how very long term outcomes can be studied through linkage of clinical trials to routine health care data sources.  \n\nThe IMPORT dataset will continue to be enlarged and enriched with tumour molecular information (copy number, genomic sequencing) and imaging review data (CT/MRI scans). These data items are not available for the previous closed trials.\n\n\nOptional material if needed:\n\nPlans for the linked dataset with the national cancer registration and analysis service (NCRAS) of Public Health England. \n\nThis project will create a new permanent data linkage between each patient\u2019s trial identifier and data and their existing national cancer registration record, with all personally identifiable data being handled within the existing nationally approved information governance and data protection frameworks of the clinical trial units and the cancer registration service of each nation. The following technical description applies to Public Health England\u2019s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). Access to the linked community prescription data is made available through PHE\u2019s Office for Data Release.\n\nNCRAS routinely collects and quality assures clinical information on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England to construct a cancer registration record.  The data collected by NCRAS comes from several sources including Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings and pathology reports. The patient identifiers collected facilitate linkage to other routinely collected datasets, that include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, mortality data, the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy and Radiotherapy datasets from all hospital providers and community dispensed prescriptions data. \n\nPatient-level linkage to inpatient HES is routinely processed by NCRAS. PHE receives pseudonymised dispensed prescriptions data from NHS Business Services Authority, allowing patient-level linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset without revealing the identities of those without cancer.  Prescription data is available from April 2015 to February 2019, providing a 3-4 year window of prescription drug usage by survivors of childhood renal tumours. \n\nThe project\u2019s primary aim is addressed by calculating cumulative and relative risks of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions from the HES-linked data set and relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs compared to the general population rates. This newly created linked dataset can be refreshed for future follow up studies and linkage to additional datasets that may become available such as patient-reported outcome measures.\n\nFor HES-based analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 1997 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For community prescriptions analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 2015 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For both sets of analyses, follow-up will end at whichever is earliest of death, emigration, latest date for which linked death certificate data are complete, and the latest date for which data are complete in the linked databases for HES or community prescriptions as applicable.\n\nCumulative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated from the HES-linked data set with death treated as a competing risk.  Relative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated by dividing the observed number in the HES-linked data set by the expected number obtained by multiplying the number of person-years accumulated in each age-sex-calendar year stratum in the study cohort by the general population rate in the corresponding stratum calculated from the entire HES database.  Relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs will be estimated in a similar way using the linked community prescription data set and the entire community prescription database.",

All of the trial/study datasets include: Full patient and tumour\ndemographics, including associated congenital abnormalities, tumour stage, treatment received (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) with individual drug names and doses and additional pathological details on histological subtype (risk group), follow up for relapse and death. In addition, the most recent study \u2013 \u201cIMPORT\u201d (Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood) contains data on the presenting symptoms that led to diagnosis of kidney cancer,\nan imaging archive of CT and MRI scans sent for central radiology review and biological samples (frozen tumour, blood, normal kidney) stored centrally on ~two\nthirds of cases. There is also tumour genomic copy number data available on about one third of the prior trial \u2013 SIOP WT 2001 (that ran in the UK, 2002-2011).\n\nChildhood renal tumour dataset\n\nThis document describes the research dataset constructed through the Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study from 2012 \u2013 2019 (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/study-improving-treatment-children-kidney-cancer. The aim of this prospective clinical observational study is to achieve continuous improvement in short and long term outcomes for children with Wilms tumour and other rarer types of childhood renal tumours. The study collects clinical, molecular and imaging data to underpin the introduction of a more personalised approach to risk stratification \u2013 the process by which each child is assigned to one of several \u2018standard of care\u2019 treatment arms according to the predicted risk of their tumour recurring. \n\nIt is a live database, currently comprising data on 670 children with kidney tumours who are resident across the UK and Republic of Ireland. This represents >90% of all incident cases diagnosed in the population. Clinical data and patient samples are collected with explicit consent of their parent/guardian for use in research and for sharing with the relevant national cancer registration service according to where the child is resident at diagnosis.\n\nData are collected throughout the patient journey and are presented in tables with each data item as a comma separated value (CSV) corresponding to a data field captured through a case report form (CRF). These span the following timepoints from presentation to completion of treatment and then annual follow up or reporting of any events (relapse/death/second tumour). \n\nF1 Registration information\nF2 Pre-operative chemotherapy (Unilateral tumours only)\nF3 Surgical form \u2013 operative findings\nF4 Pathology form \u2013 institutional pathologist\nF6 Post-operative chemotherapy\nF11 Cardiotoxicity reporting form\nF12 Bilateral Wilms tumour form \u2013 additional registration information (12a) and response assessment (12b)\nF15 Reference Pathology \u2013 \u201cCentral review\u201d\nF17 Treatment of relapse or progression\nF18 Follow up form \u2013 for annual follow up reporting and to report any relapse or death.\nF20A End of treatment summary (Unilateral tumours)\nF20B End of treatment summary (Bilateral tumours)\n\nDetails of the content of each CRF are in the table below.\n\nMost children (~90%) with Wilms tumour survive their cancer. Hence, an important aspect of the dataset is the planned linkage of each child\u2019s data to their national cancer registration record. This will permit measurement of very long term health outcomes in adulthood by linkage to routine health care data utilising the approved information governance systems through which the UK\u2019s national cancer registration services work with the NHS to ensure patient confidentiality. \n\nThe IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020.\n\nThese trials\u2019 primary endpoints, of relapse-free and overall survival according to clinically defined risk groups, have been published, with full clinical quality assurance completed. Over that 39 year period, risk stratification and treatment schedules have been refined many times, to reduce exposure to therapies that may cause long term side effects such as heart damage or second tumours. These adverse \u2018late effects\u2019 may take decades before they are first seen. Hence, these linked datasets are an important proof of principle about how very long term outcomes can be studied through linkage of clinical trials to routine health care data sources.  \n\nThe IMPORT dataset will continue to be enlarged and enriched with tumour molecular information (copy number, genomic sequencing) and imaging review data (CT/MRI scans). These data items are not available for the previous closed trials.\n\n\nOptional material if needed:\n\nPlans for the linked dataset with the national cancer registration and analysis service (NCRAS) of Public Health England. \n\nThis project will create a new permanent data linkage between each patient\u2019s trial identifier and data and their existing national cancer registration record, with all personally identifiable data being handled within the existing nationally approved information governance and data protection frameworks of the clinical trial units and the cancer registration service of each nation. The following technical description applies to Public Health England\u2019s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). Access to the linked community prescription data is made available through PHE\u2019s Office for Data Release.\n\nNCRAS routinely collects and quality assures clinical information on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England to construct a cancer registration record.  The data collected by NCRAS comes from several sources including Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings and pathology reports. The patient identifiers collected facilitate linkage to other routinely collected datasets, that include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, mortality data, the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy and Radiotherapy datasets from all hospital providers and community dispensed prescriptions data. \n\nPatient-level linkage to inpatient HES is routinely processed by NCRAS. PHE receives pseudonymised dispensed prescriptions data from NHS Business Services Authority, allowing patient-level linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset without revealing the identities of those without cancer.  Prescription data is available from April 2015 to February 2019, providing a 3-4 year window of prescription drug usage by survivors of childhood renal tumours. \n\nThe project\u2019s primary aim is addressed by calculating cumulative and relative risks of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions from the HES-linked data set and relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs compared to the general population rates. This newly created linked dataset can be refreshed for future follow up studies and linkage to additional datasets that may become available such as patient-reported outcome measures.\n\nFor HES-based analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 1997 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For community prescriptions analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 2015 and date of renal tumour diagnosis.  For both sets of analyses, follow-up will end at whichever is earliest of death, emigration, latest date for which linked death certificate data are complete, and the latest date for which data are complete in the linked databases for HES or community prescriptions as applicable.\n\nCumulative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated from the HES-linked data set with death treated as a competing risk.  Relative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated by dividing the observed number in the HES-linked data set by the expected number obtained by multiplying the number of person-years accumulated in each age-sex-calendar year stratum in the study cohort by the general population rate in the corresponding stratum calculated from the entire HES database.  Relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs will be estimated in a similar way using the linked community prescription data set and the entire community prescription database.",

Recruitment has taken place in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland since 2013 and is ongoing, with >10,000 participants aged 30-69 to date. The population of Leicester is diverse and additional recruitment from the local South Asian community is ongoing. Participants provided a DNA sample, have consented to follow-up for up to 25 years through electronic health records and additional bespoke data collection is planned. Data available includes baseline demographics, anthropometry, spirometry, lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol use) and longitudinal health information from primary care records, with additional linkage to other EHR datasets planned. Patients have consented to be contacted for recall-by-genotype and recall-by-phenotype sub-studies. Genome-wide genotype data are available via EGA for 5218 individuals.",

Recruitment has taken place in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland since 2013 and is ongoing, with >10,000 participants aged 30-69 to date. The population of Leicester is diverse and additional recruitment from the local South Asian community is ongoing. Participants provided a DNA sample, have consented to follow-up for up to 25 years through electronic health records and additional bespoke data collection is planned. Data available includes baseline demographics, anthropometry, spirometry, lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol use) and longitudinal health information from primary care records, with additional linkage to other EHR datasets planned. Patients have consented to be contacted for recall-by-genotype and recall-by-phenotype sub-studies. Genome-wide genotype data are available via EGA for 5218 individuals.",

Between 2001-2005 1.2 million women aged 50-74 years were invited from the general population and 202,638 post-menopausal were randomised (2:1:1) to routine care, or annual CA125 blood testing (7-11 rounds) or ultrasound to evaluate the impact of ovarian cancer screening on disease mortality. All participants provided a serum sample at recruitment with 50,262 providing further longitudinal annual samples (median of 9 samples). Women were free of any active malignancy at enrolment (2001-2005). During the follow-up period of >15 years to-date a proportion of those have subsequently developed a number of different diseases. Available comprehensive electronic health record linkage of the cohort's participants (including Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); ONS (Cancer registry, Death Certificates); National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN); and Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) allows exploiting clinical phenotyping and diseases diagnoses made during routine healthcare in the NHS. Women were also sent postal questionnaires. Secondary studies have to date generated additional data on symptoms, menopause and its management and further details of individual cancers. \nThe biobank contains >540,000 high-quality serum samples (10 x 500\u00ce\u00bcL aliquots in straws), composed of baseline (from >189,000 women) and a unique longitudinal set of >350,000 annual serial samples (median 9) (from approximately 50,200 women). Samples have already been validated for multi-omics analysis with academic and commercial collaborators in nested case/controls sets used for genotyping, proteomics (including SWATH technology), methylation, NMR metabolomics, autoantibody profiling, ELISA-based assays, lipidomics and miRNA.\nWe provide access to collection of samples and data across the following diseases: \n\u2022\tCerebrovascular accident (disorder)\n\u2022\tDementia (disorder)\n\u2022\tFit and well\n\u2022\tHeart disease (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant neoplasm of endometrium of corpus uteri (disorder)\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of breast, Malignant tumour of colon, Malignant tumour of lung, Malignant tumour of ovary\n\u2022\tMalignant tumour of pancreas\nAll data is stored in the IG Toolkit-compliant and ISO 27001:2013-certified UCL Data Safe Haven.\nAll samples from the biobank have been collected using a standardised protocol and stored in liquid nitrogen at HTA licensed facilities at UK Biocentre, Oxford, UK.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires contact details - name, address, email address, phone/mobile number - from participants at recruitment.  This is used to recontact participants to invite them to take part in experimental medicine studies, although sample-only and data-only studies are permitted.  We also record NHS number, where known, to allow linkage to healthcare records. Recruitment takes place at blood donor centres, disease clinics, online (particularly for the Mental Health BioResource) but also from more public settings. A participant is not considered a member of the NIHR BioResource without contact details. NHS number availability depends on recruitment method: blood donors and those recruited through clinics will have these to hand, general members of the public will not.",

      "description": "The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) nationally representative general practice sentinel network and database\nNational primary care sentinel network:\nThe RCGP RSC is nationally representative a network of over 500 general practices (GP) providing pseudonymised data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases; our data are also available for quality improvement, research and education.  Research based on the RCGP RSC data have been published in the best journals including BMJ, Lancet and Diabetes Care.\nObservational research\nThe disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases including influenza. The RCGP RSC is a nationally representative population.  The RCGP RSC and PHE, and its predecessor organizations have an over 50-year history of collaboration in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness studies.  Each practice in the network is reported on by all 37 infectious disease on a weekly basis and are graphically compared with the network as a whole (on their own web based dashboard); this drives both quality improvement in clinical care and also raises data quality, with our practice liaison team providing timely support to practices requiring help with any disparities in their information.  Thus, the observational researcher benefits from a data warehouse of patient level records going back decades with consistently coded data, able to support both longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs.\nInterventional research \u2013 ambition to be a hub for trials \nThe RCGP RSC has produced a \u2018Weekly Return\u2019 of infections and respiratory disease since 1967, though over time it has expanded in terms of size, scope, sample collection and its capability with linking with other datasets. The databases systems at the RCGP RSC can process large numbers of patients\u2019 data rapidly. The typical duration for generating the weekly report is under 4 hours. The weekly report reached its highest denominator of 3 million patients in last week of October 2019.\nThe RCGP RSC hosts Workload Observatory (funded by NHS England) for GPs to understand trends of patients with multiple and more complex conditions. Using disease specific dashboards, general practices are provided weekly updated data quality indicators and comparison with other practices in the RCGP RSC network. This process allows practices to continuously improve their data quality and increase the quality of the RCGP RSC studies over time.\nWe regularly administer questionnaires in our studies and are experienced in collecting samples from our network of practices.  Practice level support from our dedicated practice liaison team is enhanced by our suite of dashboard technologies delivering rapid feedback to each of our practices. Hence combing our expertise in real world data analysis, high frequency of practice support and our continual development of internet-based practice level interaction, we are well placed for providing a low cost pragmatic trials platform for quality improvement studies or as a medicinal trials platform. \n\nClinical concepts are ontologically defined for clinical concepts as part of developing a study protocol.  We have clinical and programming expertise to assist researchers in developing new ontologies for case finding and have a pool of existing ontologies and associated computer algorithms for extracting the data.  \n\n\nWe have ongoing research across a wide range of medical areas, with international collaborations in child health, diabetes and influenza vaccination and have an extensive set of data extraction, processing and analytic procedures we have developed which are readily available to existing and new research collaborators.",

This may often take the form of a dashboard and quality improvement activity, domain related but under the editorial control of RCGP RSC. \nCosting process \nApplicants will be responsible for any costs associated with data extraction and other aspects of collaboration. Costs are kept to a minimum. However, a RCGP RSC Practice Development Fund contribution in included to develop benefits and data quality in member practices.  Broadly 10% of the value of contracts is reinvested into member practices, in addition to any payments for research work undertaken. \nAny potential costs will be discussed at the monthly RCGP RSC Operational meeting, held each month, and researchers will be contacted as soon after the meeting as possible. Data extraction can start once these costs have been through a University approval process and formal agreements are in place.\nFor studies requiring active participation of General Practices, a contribution to cover practice staff members\u2019 time and expenses will be expected.  This is set broadly in line with National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) levels of charges for practice time.\nPlease contact the RCGP RSC team via the webpage https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/our-programmes/research-and-surveillance-centre.aspx.

        "description": "The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) nationally representative general practice sentinel network and database\nNational primary care sentinel network:\nThe RCGP RSC is nationally representative a network of over 500 general practices (GP) providing pseudonymised data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases; our data are also available for quality improvement, research and education.  Research based on the RCGP RSC data have been published in the best journals including BMJ, Lancet and Diabetes Care.\nObservational research\nThe disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases including influenza. The RCGP RSC is a nationally representative population.  The RCGP RSC and PHE, and its predecessor organizations have an over 50-year history of collaboration in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness studies.  Each practice in the network is reported on by all 37 infectious disease on a weekly basis and are graphically compared with the network as a whole (on their own web based dashboard); this drives both quality improvement in clinical care and also raises data quality, with our practice liaison team providing timely support to practices requiring help with any disparities in their information.  Thus, the observational researcher benefits from a data warehouse of patient level records going back decades with consistently coded data, able to support both longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs.\nInterventional research \u2013 ambition to be a hub for trials \nThe RCGP RSC has produced a \u2018Weekly Return\u2019 of infections and respiratory disease since 1967, though over time it has expanded in terms of size, scope, sample collection and its capability with linking with other datasets. The databases systems at the RCGP RSC can process large numbers of patients\u2019 data rapidly. The typical duration for generating the weekly report is under 4 hours. The weekly report reached its highest denominator of 3 million patients in last week of October 2019.\nThe RCGP RSC hosts Workload Observatory (funded by NHS England) for GPs to understand trends of patients with multiple and more complex conditions. Using disease specific dashboards, general practices are provided weekly updated data quality indicators and comparison with other practices in the RCGP RSC network. This process allows practices to continuously improve their data quality and increase the quality of the RCGP RSC studies over time.\nWe regularly administer questionnaires in our studies and are experienced in collecting samples from our network of practices.  Practice level support from our dedicated practice liaison team is enhanced by our suite of dashboard technologies delivering rapid feedback to each of our practices. Hence combing our expertise in real world data analysis, high frequency of practice support and our continual development of internet-based practice level interaction, we are well placed for providing a low cost pragmatic trials platform for quality improvement studies or as a medicinal trials platform. \n\nClinical concepts are ontologically defined for clinical concepts as part of developing a study protocol.  We have clinical and programming expertise to assist researchers in developing new ontologies for case finding and have a pool of existing ontologies and associated computer algorithms for extracting the data.  \n\n\nWe have ongoing research across a wide range of medical areas, with international collaborations in child health, diabetes and influenza vaccination and have an extensive set of data extraction, processing and analytic procedures we have developed which are readily available to existing and new research collaborators.",

GMCs recruit and consent patients. They then provide DNA samples and clinical information for analysis.\n\nIllumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient\u2019s doctor.\n\nTo help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data \u2013 to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.\n\nFind out more\n\nTo learn more about how we work you can read the 100,000 Genomes Project protocol. It has details of the development, delivery and operation of the project. It also sets out the patient and clinical benefit, scientific and transformational objectives, the implementation strategy and the ethical and governance frameworks.",

        "description": "To identify and enrol participants for the 100,000 Genomes Project we have created NHS Genomic Medicine Centres (GMCs). Each centre includes several NHS Trusts and hospitals. GMCs recruit and consent patients. They then provide DNA samples and clinical information for analysis.\n\nIllumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient\u2019s doctor.\n\nTo help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data \u2013 to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.\n\nFind out more\n\nTo learn more about how we work you can read the 100,000 Genomes Project protocol. It has details of the development, delivery and operation of the project. It also sets out the patient and clinical benefit, scientific and transformational objectives, the implementation strategy and the ethical and governance frameworks.",

The DNA Bank also has clinical information (divided into a minimum and extended dataset) which is available to researchers.\nThe Cell Lines Collection offers a sub set of the DNA Bank samples as EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes.

      "description": "Background:\nThe Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Lab (LBSPL) is based at St James's University Hospital and is an important element in the Leeds Clinical Research Facility (LCRF). LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.  These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities.\nThe Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 years later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).  \n\nCurrent situation:\nThe LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established. From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.  \n\nSample processing and clinical data:\nSamples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.\nFull clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.  \nTo find further information about collaborative access to these RTB samples please e-mail Roz Banks or Jo Brown at rtb@leeds.ac.uk.",

The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system.\nFull clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.  \nTo find further information about collaborative access to these RTB samples please e-mail Roz Banks or Jo Brown at rtb@leeds.ac.uk.",

In addition the tissue bank archives whole brain samples from patients with epilepsy and particularly epilepsy-related deaths, such as sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).\nWe have a donor registry for people who have epilepsy, seizures or who are healthy, without seizures, who wish to donate brain tissue following death.",

The CMO for Wales commissioned a collaboration of national bodies in Wales (NWIS, DU, NWSSP, PHW) to identify \u201chigh risk\u201d people for the Welsh population, based largely on the NHS Digital methodology. This list is referred to as the Shielded Patient List (SPL). \n\nThe \u201chigh risk\u201d list was defined as a subset of a wider group of people who may be \u201cat risk\u201d. Specific advice applies to these groups, currently this advice is:\n \u2022 \u201cAt Risk\u201d \u2013 large group normally at risk from the flu - should practice strict social distancing \n\u2022 \u201cAt high risk\u201d \u2013 a smaller sub-group (circa 70k), defined by CMO \u2013 should practice complete social \u201cshielding\u201d NHS Digital have described the methodology that has been used to identify patients who meet the high risk criteria due to their inclusion in one or more of the disease groups. \n\nAs there are differences in some of the systems used across the devolved nations, nuanced differences in application and interpretation of CMO guidance, this document describes the Welsh methodology.\n\nhttps://nwis.nhs.wales/coronavirus/coronavirus-content/coronavirus-documents/covid-19-high-risk-shielded-patient-list-identification-methodology/",

The CMO for Wales commissioned a collaboration of national bodies in Wales (NWIS, DU, NWSSP, PHW) to identify \u201chigh risk\u201d people for the Welsh population, based largely on the NHS Digital methodology. This list is referred to as the Shielded Patient List (SPL). \n\nThe \u201chigh risk\u201d list was defined as a subset of a wider group of people who may be \u201cat risk\u201d. Specific advice applies to these groups, currently this advice is:\n \u2022 \u201cAt Risk\u201d \u2013 large group normally at risk from the flu - should practice strict social distancing \n\u2022 \u201cAt high risk\u201d \u2013 a smaller sub-group (circa 70k), defined by CMO \u2013 should practice complete social \u201cshielding\u201d NHS Digital have described the methodology that has been used to identify patients who meet the high risk criteria due to their inclusion in one or more of the disease groups. \n\nAs there are differences in some of the systems used across the devolved nations, nuanced differences in application and interpretation of CMO guidance, this document describes the Welsh methodology.\n\nhttps://nwis.nhs.wales/coronavirus/coronavirus-content/coronavirus-documents/covid-19-high-risk-shielded-patient-list-identification-methodology/",

      "description": "A regional asset for Yorkshire and Humber Data, a population-based database of all children and young people (0\u201329 years) diagnosed with cancer residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region in England (10,000 tumour registrations in children aged 0-14 years since 1974 and Adolescents and Young Adults aged 15-29 years since 1990). The database contains detailed information on clinical prognostic factors including detailed treatment and stage information. A unique quality of the Yorkshire Register is that it has pre-linked data with hospital admissions datasets including inpatient, outpatient, A&E, Mental Health HES which has been used to explore long-term morbidity in the cohort. Primary care linked data have been requested and are pending. Linked educational attainment and unemployment/social benefits data are currently being sought (ethical approval in place). Demand is largely underpinned by ongoing epidemiological and cancer\noutcomes requests from University postgraduate researchers, PGT students, and other children\u2019s tumour registers. However, pharma has also requested some of the registry data. Ethics and Research Governance are all current, the former approved as a Research Database by the Northern & Yorkshire MREC (Ref MREC 0/3/1) from which data can be requested by external researchers, and approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group to process identifiable patient data without consent (Ref\u2014CAG 1-07(b)/2014). The Register goes beyond the dataset held by NCRAS in having much more rich and detailed treatment histories of every patient through active follow-up so beyond the traditional 6-month window since diagnosis used by NCRAS, as well as more complete tumour staging information. Register also records any cancer recurrence alongside any subsequent treatment received. \n\nThe Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People exists primarily to underpin epidemiological research examining the patterns and causes of cancer in children and young people and to facilitate health services research describing the patient experience in the context of care received by health professionals. The YSRCCYP is an established information resource for local clinicians and commissioners, and forms the basis for national and international collaborative research.\nThe core aims of the YSRCCYP are to:\n\u2022\tMaintain the accurate and complete collection of clinical and socio-demographic data on children, teenagers and young adults with cancer in Yorkshire, specifically information not otherwise available from other routine NHS sources.\n\u2022\tInvestigate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery for children and young people, specifically the impact on survival and long-term health.\n\u2022\tUndertake epidemiological research, comprising incidence and survival analyses.\n\u2022\tDescribe environmental risk factors for childhood and young adult cancer.\n\nExample of three recent research studies by the Yorkshire Register research team are as follows:\n\n1. Respiratory morbidity in young people surviving cancer: Population based study of hospital admissions, treatment related risk factors and subsequent mortality\n(Smith et al, 2019)\n\nRespiratory diseases are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality amongst childhood cancer survivors. This population-based study provides comprehensive analysis of hospitalisations for respiratory conditions, the associated risks of admission by earlier cancer treatment and trends in readmissions and subsequent mortality in long-term survivors of cancers diagnosed under 30 years. The risk of hospitalisation was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to the general population. Treatment with chemotherapy with known lung toxicity was associated with an increased risk of admissions for all respiratory disease especially pneumonia. Subsequent mortality was highest in those admitted for pneumonia compared to other respiratory conditions.\n\n2. Long term survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: population-based trends in cure and relapse by clinical characteristics\n(Smith et al, 2018)\n\nStatistical \u201ccure models\u201d provide additional metrics useful to identify and describe trends in survival. Additional measures include the proportion cured which is a summary of the long term survival and the median survival of the uncured which give information on those who are not long-term survivors. In this study we used a statistical cure model to explore trends in long-term survival and relapse for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over time and by clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients cured, defined either by overall survival or relapse free survival, has increased over time while there was slight decrease in the median survival time of the uncured. We also observed a significant reduction in the risk of relapse over time.\n\n3. Comparison of ethnic group classification using naming analysis and routinely collected data\n(Smith et al, 2017)\n\nIn this study we compared cancer incidence trends using different methods for assigning ethnic groups to individuals: 1 \u2013 using ethnic group recorded in hospital medical records, 2 \u2013 using a naming software program to assign an ethnic group based on the ethnic origins of the individuals and 3 \u2013 using a combination of both processes. We found that using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source.\n\nhttps://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-institute-cardiovascular-metabolic-medicine/doc/yorkshire-specialist-register-cancer-children-young-people",

        "description": "A regional asset for Yorkshire and Humber Data, a population-based database of all children and young people (0\u201329 years) diagnosed with cancer residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region in England (10,000 tumour registrations in children aged 0-14 years since 1974 and Adolescents and Young Adults aged 15-29 years since 1990). The database contains detailed information on clinical prognostic factors including detailed treatment and stage information. A unique quality of the Yorkshire Register is that it has pre-linked data with hospital admissions datasets including inpatient, outpatient, A&E, Mental Health HES which has been used to explore long-term morbidity in the cohort. Primary care linked data have been requested and are pending. Linked educational attainment and unemployment/social benefits data are currently being sought (ethical approval in place). Demand is largely underpinned by ongoing epidemiological and cancer\noutcomes requests from University postgraduate researchers, PGT students, and other children\u2019s tumour registers. However, pharma has also requested some of the registry data. Ethics and Research Governance are all current, the former approved as a Research Database by the Northern & Yorkshire MREC (Ref MREC 0/3/1) from which data can be requested by external researchers, and approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group to process identifiable patient data without consent (Ref\u2014CAG 1-07(b)/2014). The Register goes beyond the dataset held by NCRAS in having much more rich and detailed treatment histories of every patient through active follow-up so beyond the traditional 6-month window since diagnosis used by NCRAS, as well as more complete tumour staging information. Register also records any cancer recurrence alongside any subsequent treatment received. \n\nThe Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People exists primarily to underpin epidemiological research examining the patterns and causes of cancer in children and young people and to facilitate health services research describing the patient experience in the context of care received by health professionals. The YSRCCYP is an established information resource for local clinicians and commissioners, and forms the basis for national and international collaborative research.\nThe core aims of the YSRCCYP are to:\n\u2022\tMaintain the accurate and complete collection of clinical and socio-demographic data on children, teenagers and young adults with cancer in Yorkshire, specifically information not otherwise available from other routine NHS sources.\n\u2022\tInvestigate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery for children and young people, specifically the impact on survival and long-term health.\n\u2022\tUndertake epidemiological research, comprising incidence and survival analyses.\n\u2022\tDescribe environmental risk factors for childhood and young adult cancer.\n\nExample of three recent research studies by the Yorkshire Register research team are as follows:\n\n1. Respiratory morbidity in young people surviving cancer: Population based study of hospital admissions, treatment related risk factors and subsequent mortality\n(Smith et al, 2019)\n\nRespiratory diseases are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality amongst childhood cancer survivors. This population-based study provides comprehensive analysis of hospitalisations for respiratory conditions, the associated risks of admission by earlier cancer treatment and trends in readmissions and subsequent mortality in long-term survivors of cancers diagnosed under 30 years. The risk of hospitalisation was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to the general population. Treatment with chemotherapy with known lung toxicity was associated with an increased risk of admissions for all respiratory disease especially pneumonia. Subsequent mortality was highest in those admitted for pneumonia compared to other respiratory conditions.\n\n2. Long term survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: population-based trends in cure and relapse by clinical characteristics\n(Smith et al, 2018)\n\nStatistical \u201ccure models\u201d provide additional metrics useful to identify and describe trends in survival. Additional measures include the proportion cured which is a summary of the long term survival and the median survival of the uncured which give information on those who are not long-term survivors. In this study we used a statistical cure model to explore trends in long-term survival and relapse for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over time and by clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients cured, defined either by overall survival or relapse free survival, has increased over time while there was slight decrease in the median survival time of the uncured. We also observed a significant reduction in the risk of relapse over time.\n\n3. Comparison of ethnic group classification using naming analysis and routinely collected data\n(Smith et al, 2017)\n\nIn this study we compared cancer incidence trends using different methods for assigning ethnic groups to individuals: 1 \u2013 using ethnic group recorded in hospital medical records, 2 \u2013 using a naming software program to assign an ethnic group based on the ethnic origins of the individuals and 3 \u2013 using a combination of both processes. We found that using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source.\n\nhttps://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-institute-cardiovascular-metabolic-medicine/doc/yorkshire-specialist-register-cancer-children-young-people",

We are particularly interested in whether interventions to reduce air pollution can improve children\u2019s lung growth and respiratory symptoms, activity levels and brain function. We are also interested in whether exposure to air pollution in childhood leaves markers on genes that reflect pollution levels over time.We have recruited over 3,300 primary school pupils across London and Luton to take part from 44 London schools and 41 Luton schools. These children will be assessed once a year for up to four years.",

The survey was conducted by Quality Health in conjunction with three cancer registries in England. The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis. Outcome items in the survey are made up of Euroqol 5-level (EQ-5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), and Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI) items.",

The survey was conducted by Quality Health in conjunction with three cancer registries in England. The survey measured the overall quality of life of representative samples of cancer survivors with breast, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during July 2006 - July 2010. Quality of life was assessed at four different time points after diagnosis at approximately one, two, three or five years. As this was a pilot survey, numbers are small and data governance issues will need to be carefully considered on a study by study basis. Outcome items in the survey are made up of Euroqol 5-level (EQ-5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), and Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI) items.",

      "description": "ALSPAC was established to understand how genetic, biological, environmental, social, psychological and psychosocial factors influence the health and development of children and their parents. ALSPAC is a multi-generation prospective cohort based in Bristol in the South West of England. More than 14,000 women (G0) were enrolled in 1991 and 1992. Their partners (also G0), children (G1) and now grandchildren (G2) have been recruited and followed up over multiple timepoints. A wide variety of biological samples have been collected along with a vast array of exposure and outcome data collected via questionnaire, face to face clinics and through linkage to administrative data.\n\nDuring the index pregnancy women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent almost annual questionnaires asking about their own health and well-being. From 2008, women were invited to attend four focus clinical assessments. Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with multiple data collection time points since birth. These include numerous child-completed questionnaires, a number of clinical assessments from the age of 7 years and further questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver. Partners of the mothers have also completed a number of questionnaires and been invited to one focus clinic assessment. The second generation (children of the children) have been and continue to be recruited with data collected via questionnaire and clinical assessment at multiple time points.\n\nDataset has multiple releases (not scheduled)",

        "description": "ALSPAC was established to understand how genetic, biological, environmental, social, psychological and psychosocial factors influence the health and development of children and their parents. ALSPAC is a multi-generation prospective cohort based in Bristol in the South West of England. More than 14,000 women (G0) were enrolled in 1991 and 1992. Their partners (also G0), children (G1) and now grandchildren (G2) have been recruited and followed up over multiple timepoints. A wide variety of biological samples have been collected along with a vast array of exposure and outcome data collected via questionnaire, face to face clinics and through linkage to administrative data.\n\nDuring the index pregnancy women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent almost annual questionnaires asking about their own health and well-being. From 2008, women were invited to attend four focus clinical assessments. Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with multiple data collection time points since birth. These include numerous child-completed questionnaires, a number of clinical assessments from the age of 7 years and further questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver. Partners of the mothers have also completed a number of questionnaires and been invited to one focus clinic assessment. The second generation (children of the children) have been and continue to be recruited with data collected via questionnaire and clinical assessment at multiple time points.\n\nDataset has multiple releases (not scheduled)",

Data is de-identified at source (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) and ResearchOne) and linked using matching pseudonymous digests that are re-pseudonymised upon linkage by University of Leeds IT to produce irreversibly pseudonymous data that is processed into a research dataset. The data relates to the medical history of cancer patients prior to cancer, during their cancer diagnosis and treatment, and following their long-term outcomes, and the medical history of matched non-cancer patients that form a comparator cohort.\n\nThe data relates to 431,352 patients in the UK that LTHT have a \u2018legitimate patient relationship\u2019 with and that were determined by LTHT to have had a cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2018 or be a matched non-cancer patient. Where available, data from ResearchOne provides primary care information for these patients. Where the patients were invited to participate in a patient reported outcomes measures survey (PROMS), this status is recorded. Where the patient returned a consented PROMS, the PROMS data will also be available once it has completed the extract, transform and load process. \n\nThe dataset is currently 5.7 GB and further ResearchOne and PROMS data is anticipated. The dataset is arranged as a relational database, with tables linking on the patient level by a pseudonymous digest. Each table is a comma separated values (CSV) file and relates to an event type, such as prescription cost, address history or diagnosis. All patients have an entry (row) in the demographics table; the number of times a patient has an entry in the other tables depends on how many events of that type were recorded for the patient. \n\nThe dataset is split into two files, each with similar table structure; the main dataset contains all patients and the PROMs dataset contains only those in the PROMs cohort (for whom additional PROMs data will be added). Each table has a re-pseudonymised digest field, \u201cDigest2\u201d and an indicator as to whether the patient has data from ResearchOne available, \u201cTPP_Linked\u201d (0 or 1).

The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds.\nA Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer.\nStatistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome.\nThe Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine.

A modelling exercise in collaboration with German scientists, will help to devise the prediction model, to predict pollen shedding and dispersal up to 3 days prior to the event. This is important to allow patients and other stakeholders to plan for an impending peak of pollen allergy and it\u2019s subsequent associated complications.\n\nThe outcome of this project will help to use the eDPSEEA model in other countries as well, as it is currently being used in Malaysia too. \n\nFor further information, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/respire/chronic-respiratory-disorders/seasonal-pollen-induced-asthma",

PROMs are a means of collecting information on the effectiveness of care delivered to NHS patients as perceived by the patients themselves. The collection of this data will add to the set of information available on the care delivered to NHS-funded patients and will complement, and be used in conjunction with, existing information on the quality of services. Data was released for the first time as an experimental statistic in April 2010 at which time the extract service was also launched. \n\nThe PROMs dataset is made up of many data items relating to information collected through the Patient Reported Outcome Measures questionnaires completed by patients for a number of common elective procedures. Patients submit the questionnaires before and after their operation in order to establish their perceived levels of health and the impact the operation has had on their quality of life. The PROMs dataset includes responses to individual questions as well as overall totals for a number of different scoring systems for both pre-operative and post-operative questionnaires",

PROMs are a means of collecting information on the effectiveness of care delivered to NHS patients as perceived by the patients themselves. The collection of this data will add to the set of information available on the care delivered to NHS-funded patients and will complement, and be used in conjunction with, existing information on the quality of services. Data was released for the first time as an experimental statistic in April 2010 at which time the extract service was also launched. \n\nThe PROMs dataset is made up of many data items relating to information collected through the Patient Reported Outcome Measures questionnaires completed by patients for a number of common elective procedures. Patients submit the questionnaires before and after their operation in order to establish their perceived levels of health and the impact the operation has had on their quality of life. The PROMs dataset includes responses to individual questions as well as overall totals for a number of different scoring systems for both pre-operative and post-operative questionnaires",

Please note that pseudo_tumour_ids in AV tables and in SACT are assigned to participants by NCRAS and do not link to the tumour_ids assigned by GeL for sequencing and clinical data. Whilst (particularly in the case of single tumour) this may refer to the same cancer, caution should be applied prior to any analysis.\n        \n        av_patient\t\n        \n        Patient information - demographics and death details.\n        av_tumour\t\n        \n        Tumour catalogue and characterisation for all patients with registerable tumour.

Using these datasets cancers registered in England which were diagnosed in 2006 to 2016 are categorised into one of eight Routes to Diagnosis. The methodology is described in detail in the British Journal of Cancer article 'Routes to Diagnosis for cancer - Determining the patient journey using multiple routine datasets'.\n        cwt\n        \n        The National Cancer Waiting Times Monitoring Data Set supports the continued management and monitoring of waiting times\n        \n        sact\n        \n        Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (chemotherapy detail) data for cancer participants from PHE covering regimens between 03/2015 and 12/2017.

The purpose of the standard is to collect consistent and comparable data across all NHS Acute Trust providers of radiotherapy services in England in order to provide intelligence for service planning, commissioning, clinical practice and research and the operational provision of radiotherapy services across England.\n        \n        Data is available from 01/04/2009.

The DID captures information about referral source, details of the test (type of test and body site), demographic information such as GP registered practice, patient postcode, ethnicity, gender and date of birth, plus data items about different events (date of imaging request, date of imaging, date of reporting, which allows calculation of time intervals.\n        \n        Data is available for patients diagnosed between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015.\n        \n        lucada_2013\tThe National Lung Cancer Audit (LUCADA) looks at the care delivered during referral, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes for people diagnosed with lung cancer and mesothelioma. The data items in the LUCADA dataset have been compiled to meet the requirements of audit, and are not to be confused with the data items identified as Lung Cancer in the National Cancer dataset. The audit focuses on measuring the care given to lung cancer patients from diagnosis to the primary treatment package, assessing against standards and bringing about necessary improvements.

SAIL is currently expediting all requests that feed directly into the response to the COVID-19 national emergency, and therefore requests from NHS or Government institutions, or organisations working alongside such care providers and policymakers to feed intelligence directly back into the national response, are being expedited with a ~48-hour governance turnaround for such applications once made. Please make enquiries using the link at the bottom of the page which will go the SAIL Databank team, or to Chris Orton at c.orton@swansea.ac.uk\n\nSAIL is welcoming requests from other organisations and for longer-term academic study on the dataset, but please note if this is not directly relevant to the emergency research being carried out which directly interfaces with national responding agencies, there may be an access delay whilst priority use cases are serviced.",

It can be caused by a variety of single gene defects, including conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa which often result in early onset blindness in childhood, whilst the risk of age related macular degeneration is caused by a variety of complex multigene defects causing visual loss in later life. Treatments are evolving for both diseases but the underlying pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases  remains elusive. We  have formed the biobank as a repository of fibroblasts (from skin and hair samples) from patients with a variety of retinal diseases that could then be used with induced pluripotent stem cell technology  to investigate causes and new treatments for these conditions.",

        "description": "Outer retinal disease is the most common cause of blindness in the UK. It can be caused by a variety of single gene defects, including conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa which often result in early onset blindness in childhood, whilst the risk of age related macular degeneration is caused by a variety of complex multigene defects causing visual loss in later life. Treatments are evolving for both diseases but the underlying pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases  remains elusive. We  have formed the biobank as a repository of fibroblasts (from skin and hair samples) from patients with a variety of retinal diseases that could then be used with induced pluripotent stem cell technology  to investigate causes and new treatments for these conditions.",

We can also process smaller volumes of blood from blood collection tubes into buffy coat.\nPlasma\n We can either collect a specific volume of blood in the anticoagulant of your choice and prepare plasma, or you can source plasma samples that we have banked from a wide selection of donors for screening purposes.\nSerum\n We can either collect a specific volume of blood and prepare serum to suit your needs, or you can select from serum samples that we have previously banked from a wide selection of donors.\nPBMCs\n We are preparing PBMCs from whole units of blood within a very short timeframe from venepuncture (typically processing begins within 1 hour). PBMCs are produced using a density centrifugation, characterized and frozen in a proprietary freezing solution designed to maximise cell viability.\nCustom services\n We can develop specific processes to suit your exact requirements, so please get in contact if there is something specific you need for your research",

The research programme uses the unique population structures in our Scottish and Croatian cohorts to deliver biological understanding of the causes of variation in complex traits. Together, the ORCADES and VIKING biobanks contain 4,000 samples from volunteers with ancestry from the Northern Isles of Scotland, www.ed.ac.uk/viking. Collectively, the CROATIA cohorts contain 6,000 participants. All of these biobanks were constructed from people with high kinship and extensive pedigree structures. They were collected together with detailed phenotype data, some of which is longitudinal. Plasma, serum, urine and DNA samples, as well as detailed genomic, proteomic and metabolomics data can be made available for collaborative research.",

Families with children under the age of 16 are eligible, however where the household has 3 or more children, up to two children between the ages of 0 and 15 are randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Interviews are used to collect data at the household level, with questionnaires distributed to household members. Information on the household type and employment status of the household reference person are collected, and the interviewer is asked to comment on the condition of the property. Separate self-completion questionnaires are used to collect data for adults and young people (aged 13-15), whilst adults/guardians are required to complete questionnaires on behalf of children younger than 13 years old.\n\nThe WHS data, as provided via the UK Data Archive, is split into two separate datasets, these relating to adults \u2013 16 and older \u2013 and children. The WHS can be analysed at both the individual and household level, with appropriate weights being supplied for each.

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires a case report form at recruitment for each participant recruited on the basis of their disease.  Typically variables include questions that may be used to partition or group patients by their disease course and severity, and include disease history and medication use. This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies.Note: Valid metadata in DDI XML format was uploaded to the HDR UK metadata helpdesk.  While an entirely appropriate schema for capturing rich metadata, it could not be readily transformed to meet the Technical Metadata standards, which is (therefore) a poor approximation.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource acquires a case report form at recruitment for each participant recruited on the basis of their disease.  Typically variables include questions that may be used to partition or group patients by their disease course and severity, and include disease history and medication use. This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies.Note: Valid metadata in DDI XML format was uploaded to the HDR UK metadata helpdesk.  While an entirely appropriate schema for capturing rich metadata, it could not be readily transformed to meet the Technical Metadata standards, which is (therefore) a poor approximation.",

It intends to extend recruitment in all areas, and to other rare and common disease groups, with a target of ~300k by 2022. The NIHR BioResource extracts DNA from blood- and saliva- samples taken at recruitment, and measures a panel of SNPs on each DNA sample, using a commodity SNP genotyping array from e.g. Illumina or Affymetrix (now Thermofisher). This is used to pre-screen or match participants when inviting them to take part in experimental medicine studies.  De-identified versions of this data is available to researchers investigating the feasibility of future studies. The Technical Metadata describes a SNP annotation file \u2013 i.e. what the chip is measuring.  The file itself has as many rows as there are SNPs represented on the chip, and is proprietary to the manufacturer, although deeply familiar to researchers.",

        "description": "The Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's Tissue Bank is a national collection of CNS tissue samples donated by individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease and related neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions. The Tissue Bank's mission is to facilitate discoveries by making well-characterised human material of the highest quality readily available to the research community engaged in studies aimed at finding the cause and better treatments for MS and Parkinson's. Furthermore, we aim to encourage the greater use of the material in scientific studies. It is by carrying out this work that the Tissue Bank fulfills the last, generous and selfless wishes of all those who have registered on the donor scheme and bequeathed their CNS tissues to research. The work of the Tissue Bank is supported by the Multiple Sclerosis Society and Parkinson's UK in partnership with Imperial College London.",

Adversity in these periods of developmental vulnerability can have persistent effects on the long-term health of the child, including physical and mental health disorders. We also know that if a mother has complications in pregnancy, that she herself may suffer from increased risk of ill-heath in later life, for example cardiovascular disease, diabetes or mental health problems. \n\neLIXIR is a prospective collection of blood samples from routine antenatal and neonatal appointments and is due to begin collecting in 2018.",

These can arise from problems with the mother's health, her lifestyle, her physical environment, medication, the placenta not working properly, complications during birth, or as consequence of being born too early. Adversity in these periods of developmental vulnerability can have persistent effects on the long-term health of the child, including physical and mental health disorders. We also know that if a mother has complications in pregnancy, that she herself may suffer from increased risk of ill-heath in later life, for example cardiovascular disease, diabetes or mental health problems. \n\neLIXIR is a prospective collection of blood samples from routine antenatal and neonatal appointments and is due to begin collecting in 2018.",
