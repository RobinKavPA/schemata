# Release Date Schema

```txt
#/properties/provenance/temporal/distributionReleaseDate#/definitions/temporal/properties/distributionReleaseDate
```

Date of the latest release of the dataset. If this is a regular release i.e. quarterly, or this is a static dataset please complete this alongside Periodicity. If this is Irregular or Continuously released please leave this blank. Notes: Periodicity and release date will be used to determine when the next release is expected. E.g. if the release date is documented as 01/01/2020 and it is now 20/04/2020 and there is a quarterly release schedule, the latest release will be calculated as 01/04/2020.
