Please indicate if the dataset is representative of the patient pathway and any limitations the dataset may have with respect to pathway coverage. This could include if the dataset is from a single speciality or area, a single tier of care, linked across two tiers (e.g. primary and secondary care), or an integrated care record covering the whole patient pathway.
