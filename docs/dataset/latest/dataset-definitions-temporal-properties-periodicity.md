Please indicate the frequency of distribution release. If a dataset is distributed regularly please choose a distribution release periodicity from the constrained list and indicate the next release date. When the release date becomes historical, a new release date will be calculated based on the publishing periodicity. If a dataset has been published and will remain static please indicate that it is static and indicated when it was released. If a dataset is released on an irregular basis or “on-demand” please indicate that it is Irregular and leave release date as null. If a dataset can be published in real-time or near-real-time please indicate that it is continuous and leave release date as null.
